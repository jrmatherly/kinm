## What is Kinm?

Kinm (pronounced "kim", like the name) is a database-backed API server providing Kubernetes-like CRUD+Watch semantics without the complexity of etcd. It enables building scalable, resource-oriented APIs with familiar K8s patterns while keeping all state in PostgreSQL or SQLite.

### Origin Story

Kinm continues the learnings from **Mink** (Mink is not Kubernetes), a Kubernetes Aggregated API Server backed by a database. While Mink was archived when Acorn Labs pivoted away from Kubernetes products, the core idea remained valuable: provide K8s-like API capabilities without being tightly coupled to Kubernetes itself.

Kinm takes this further by:
- **Embracing SQL**: Full PostgreSQL support with efficient query patterns
- **Database-first design**: All state in the database, no in-memory caching
- **Independence from K8s**: Compatibility is not a goal (though it happens to work currently)
- **Modern architecture**: Removing K8s library bloat and version churn

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### 🔄 Kubernetes-like API

- **Complete CRUD Operations** - Create, Read, Update, Delete with K8s semantics
- **Watch Support** - Real-time change notifications via long-polling and broadcast
- **Field Selectors** - Efficient filtering using indexed fields
- **Resource Versioning** - Version chains via `previous_id` for consistency

### 🗄️ Database-Backed Storage

- **PostgreSQL** - Primary production database with advanced SQL features
- **SQLite** - Development and testing support
- **No etcd** - Pure SQL design without etcd dependencies
- **Stateless API Servers** - All state in database enables horizontal scaling

### ⚡ Performance & Scalability

- **Background Compaction** - Automatic cleanup of old resource versions
- **Efficient Watch** - Long-polling with broadcast notifications
- **Field Indexing** - Dynamic columns for fast field selector queries
- **Zero In-Memory State** - Horizontal scaling without sticky sessions

### 🔧 Developer Experience

- **Builder Pattern** - Fluent API for configuring stores (15+ pre-built variants)
- **Strategy Interfaces** - Clean separation of concerns (Create, Get, List, Update, Delete, Watch)
- **Embedded SQL** - Parameterized queries in `.sql` files
- **Testing Support** - SQLite for fast unit tests, PostgreSQL for integration tests

## 🏗️ Architecture

Kinm uses a layered architecture:

```
HTTP Clients
    ↓
pkg/server (HTTP Server + k8s GenericAPIServer)
    ↓
pkg/stores (Builder + 15+ store variants)
    ↓
pkg/strategy (CRUD+Watch adapters)
    ↓
pkg/db (Factory + Strategy + SQL statements)
    ↓
PostgreSQL / SQLite
```

**Key architectural decisions:**

- **Database-first**: All state persisted in SQL, no in-memory caching
- **Version chains**: Resources linked via `previous_id` for Watch support
- **Background compaction**: Prevents unbounded growth of version history
- **Long-polling Watch**: Efficient change notifications without WebSockets

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed diagrams and explanations.

## 🔧 Development

### Building

```bash
make build            # Build the project
go build ./...        # Direct build
```

### Testing

```bash
# Unit tests (SQLite - fast)
make test             # Run all tests with race detector
make test-short       # Run tests in short mode

# Integration tests (PostgreSQL - comprehensive)
make test-integration # Requires PostgreSQL (KINM_TEST_DB=postgres)

# Coverage
make test-coverage    # Generate coverage.html
```

### Code Quality

```bash
make lint             # Run golangci-lint
make validate         # Run all validation (lint + tests)
```

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow the existing code patterns:

- **Interface-based design** - Use strategy interfaces for extensibility
- **Builder pattern** - Fluent configuration for stores
- **Error wrapping** - Use `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)` for error chains
- **SQL-first** - Embrace database capabilities, avoid in-memory caching

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed development guidelines and patterns.
